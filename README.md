Pandas challenge

This challenge tested my abilities with Pandas. 
While nothing was too complicated, we had to deal with a lot of DataFrame manipulation and if I wasn't too careful, things could get mixed up. 

My biggest obstacle was when working on the "Scores by School Spending" section. I had a hard time getting the DF to show correctly as I was getting errors with the bins vs my data. Based off the error, I figured out it was due to my data being a STR when it needed to be an int. Eventually, I was able to convert which allowed me to get my DF to print correctly. 




PyCity Schools Analysis

Overall, test scores are low across all schools wiht an overall passing % of roughly 65%

More students are passing reading vs math, 10% more students on average pass reading vs pass math.

From the data below, the top 5 performing schools are all Charter schools where as the bottom 5 are all District Schools.

While the lower performing schools have larger student counts vs the top performing schools, they are still comparable in terms of budget per student and in some cases exceed that vs the top performers.

The top 5 tend to be somewhat even in terms of passing math vs reading, with reading having a slim edge. However the bottom 5 drastically trend towards passing reading vs math - a roughly 15% difference.

Scores per grade trend consistly from year to year

In terms of budget per student, schools that have lower budgets are scoring better than those with higher budgets.

In terms of school size, smaller schools are performing better than larger schools.

In terms of school type, charter schools perform much better versus district schools.

Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, I recommend that we analyze how some of these schools are allocating their budgets. This raises a big concern when lower budget schools are testing much better than higher budget schools. There could be a misuse of funds occuring or lower salaries being offered to teachers which misses out on better teachers.
Additionally, within the District schools, we should have a higher focus on Math to help boost those performance numbers up. Whether it be highering better teachers, allocating the budget for math tutoring, etc.
While other factors such as school size and type have some affect, I dont believe those are reasonable to tackle as it would require massive changes to the schools.
